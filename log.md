# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: September 10, 2022 

**Today's Progress**: Finished an excercise on accessibility tools and ARIA attributes, by freeCodeCamp, and caught up on updated lessons on label-input linking.
I've set up the VSC for the next assignment. 

**Thoughts**: Have to learn and remember the differences between the roles of [name], [id] and [type] 



### Day 2: September 11, 2022 

**Today's Progress**: Started a side project in VSC to excercise everything i've learned so far, mostly aiming at the styling options.

**Thoughts**: I seem to be strugling with sotring out the containers, and therefore i experience hiccoughs here and there, but overall i'm quite happy with my progress.



### Day 3: September 18, 2022 

**Today's Progress**: Finished a freeCodeCamp excercise focussed on CSS styling, SVG icons, positioning and such. 

**Thoughts**: I enjoy CSS.. I enjoy the CSS.. I enjoy CSS... So many divs.


### Day 4: September 19, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Finished an excercise on media queries and pseudo selectors by freeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts**: Blank. Movie in the background, can't focus. Will have to come back to it, as I can't remember a thing i read during the lesson.
